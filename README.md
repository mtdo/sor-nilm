The repository houses the code of an unsupervised NFHMM disaggregation
algorithm developed in a NILM related student research project for Fortum on
the Aalto University course MS-E2177 Seminar on Case Studies in Operation
Research (5 cr).

This repository is associated with
[a fork of the NILMTK available here](https://github.com/smarisa/nilmtk) which
was also created and used by us in this course project. The README of that
repository offers a little bit more insight on this code as well.

The source code is at the ``src`` folder while the ``test`` folder contains
some synthetic input data for testing. An ``out`` folder should be created to
contain the results of the algorithm.
